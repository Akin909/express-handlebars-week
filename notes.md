Proposed Structure
===
* At least half of our workshops will be code-alongs

* Using Express with postgres and deployment to heroku.
* Over course of the week we walk the cohort through incrementally building
  a favourite articles app, which shows a list of articles and saves them to
  a database on click and queries the database with favourites
